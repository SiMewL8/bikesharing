## Citi Bike Cruisin in the Big Apple 
While using Tableau, a professional Data Analysis software, we found some interesting trends and analysis regarding the bike sharing business. With near **2.3 million records for the month of August 2019 alone**, here are some of the interesting facts:

- Peak bike usage is 5-7pm, suggesting after-work social activities and tourist interactions. 
- A slight peak in 8-9am possibly represents the need for the working population to escape morning traffic with Citi Bikes.
- Starting and ending bike route stations data shows most data aggregated in Manhattan.
- 70% of bike usage is by males, and about 20% is by females.

## Des Moines, Iowa: Go for Gold?
A unique angle we took to compare Des Moines and NYC was the density of one of the most popular fast food chains: McDonalds. We compiled data to display the density of McDonalds and see if it affects the peopleâ€™s choices in where they want to go in the city. Here are quick facts about both cities from [U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219) :

Taking all of the quick facts into account, we can speculate why a Citi Bike business might be noticeably different to run in both cities. Analysis the McDonalds density analysis, we noticed some interesting details about both cities hosting the fast food franchise:

- NYC McDonalds are clustered together (21 total within 5 miles)
    - Des Moines McDonalds are spread apart, even though Des Moines Area Size is larger (14 total within 15 miles) 

- Since more NYC locations are present in clusters, more options for people to go

    - Since less DM locations are present, the increased distance will possibly diminish bike riding 

- NYC is known for attractions, tourism, the arts and being a Western cultural icon
    - DM is home to many famous insurance companies and caucus meetings to discuss and vote on the candidates for US primary and general elections

## Conclusion
While NYC is a mecca for the arts, entertainment and tourism, Des Moines currently might not have the capacity and demands for a bike sharing business. We would need more data to analyze trends in Des Moines such as city traffic, tourism profits, and population metrics.
